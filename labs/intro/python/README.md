# Introduction to Pulumi

This workshop introduces you to the basic Pulumi building blocks you need to be effective with Pulumi.

## Lab 1 - Create a Project

In this [lab](./lab-01/README.md), you'll initialize a new project in Pulumi

## Lab 2 - Configuration

In this [lab](./lab-02/README.md), you will learn about how to manage configuration in Pulumi. You'll set
values in a Pulumi project, and read them back in your code.

## Lab 3 - Stacks & Stack References

In this [lab](./lab-03/README.md), you'll learn about how stacks and configuration are related. You'll create a new
stack, and set those values. Next, we'll create a second stack, and use stack references to link values together

## Lab 4 - Docker

In this [lab](./lab-04/README.md), you'll learn about creating your very first resource using Docker. We'll build a simple Docker Image,
and run it locally on your machine using Infrastructure as Code.
