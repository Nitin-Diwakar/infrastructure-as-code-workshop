### Lab 1 - Preparing to use Pulumi with AWS

The first lab shows you how to set up your Pulumi project so that you can use Pulumi with AWS.

We'll cover:

  - Bootstrapping your Pulumi + AWS Python project
  - Setting up AWS credentials
  - Verifying your access to AWS is valid
  - Setting AWS config options in your program

### Lab 2 - Managing an S3 Bucket

The [second lab](./lab-02/README.md) shows a very simple static website deployed with Pulumi. It introduces some key Pulumi features, namely the ability to use standard programming loops. Also in this lab, we'll introduce the Pulumi concept of an Output, and how to manage these outputs when managing standard programming strings.

Once you have completed this lab, you should feel comfortable with:

 - Running your first Pulumi program in AWS
 - Pulumi's Python SDK and its type system
 - More steps in understanding Pulumi's programming model
 - How you can use traditional programming constructs in Pulumi

### Lab 3 - Deploying a Webserver
